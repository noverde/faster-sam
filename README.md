## About The Project

`Faster-SAM` is a library designed to integrate APIs built using the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) with FastAPI, enabling developers to run their AWS SAM applications outside of the AWS environment. FastAPI, known for its high-performance and easy-to-use framework for building APIs with Python, gains compatibility with AWS SAM through this specialized adapter.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- PyYaml
